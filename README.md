# Twitter Clone Project

Welcome to the Twitter Clone project! This project aims to replicate the core features and functionalities of the popular social media platform Twitter using Django, a high-level Python web framework.

## Project Overview

The Twitter Clone project consists of the following main components:

1. **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the platform securely. Passwords are hashed and stored securely in the database.

2. **Posting Tweets:** Authenticated users can post tweets, consisting of text content, images, or links. Tweets are displayed in a user's timeline and can be interacted with by other users.

3. **Following and Followers:** Users can follow and unfollow other users on the platform. A user's timeline displays tweets from users they follow.

4. **Notifications:** Users receive notifications for actions such as new followers, likes, and comments on their tweets.

5. **Likes and Retweets:** Users can like and retweet tweets posted by other users. These interactions are reflected in the tweet's metadata.

6. **Search Functionality:** Users can search for tweets, users, and topics using the search feature.
